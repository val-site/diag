--- layout: page title: About permalink: /about/ priority: 0.9 intro: | Hi, I'm Matt Grey, a multi-disciplined designer, particularly focussed around Digital Product Design, User Experience (UX), and Usability. Adopting a user-centred process, I design, prototype and test multi-platform websites and apps, as well as architect and manage design systems to drive efficiency and consistency. I aim to bridge the gap between design, tech, and the business by working cross-functionally to research and deliver real products with effective, engaging, and accessible user experiences. I am currently based in London and work as a Product Designer at [Dojo](//www.dojo.tech/), previously at [ClearScore](//www.clearscore.com/), [Acuris](//www.acuris.com/) and [Tesco](//www.tesco.com/). Prior to that I was working in Southampton as a Designer and Consultant at [Alliants](//alliants.com), where I worked with a number of clients, including: [Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts](//fourseasons.com), [Babylon Health](//babylonhealth.com), [Travelodge](//travelodge.co.uk), [Ski Solutions](//skisolutions.com), [Sun Life Financial](//www.sunlife.com), [CooperVision/Specsavers](//www.specsavers.co.uk/contact-lenses/coopervision), [Channel 5](//channel5.com), [butterfly.life](//www.butterfly.life/), [VisitBritain](//www.visitbritain.com/gb/en), and [OpenJaw Technologies](//www.openjawtech.com). In 2010 I founded a [font foundry](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Matt_Grey/), which has released a number of free and commercial [fonts](/fonts). profile_picture: /images/profile-pictures/profile.jpg experience: - company: Dojo (formerly Paymentsense) position: Product designer (Senior) period: August 2020 - Present - company: Clearscore position: Product designer, Design Systems period: July 2019 - August 2020 - company: Acuris position: Product designer (UX/UI) period: Jan 2019 - July 2019 - company: Tesco position: UI Designer period: Mar 2018 - Jan 2019 - company: Alliants position: Visual/UI/UX designer and Consultant period: Jun 2014 - Feb 2018 # - company: Techbods # position: Graphic Designer # period: Jul 2013 - Sep 2013 # - company: Leepeckgroup # position: Work Experience - Designer # period: Sep 2010 # - company: Hampshire County Council # position: Work Experience - Graphic Designer # period: Oct 2009 education: - course: Two-day User Experience Design Bootcamp place: General Assembly period: 2017 - course: Foundation Certificate in User Experience place: BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT period: 2016 - course: BA(Hons) Graphic design place: Falmouth University period: 2011 - 2014 - course: Short course, Graphic design place: Central Saint Martins (UAL) period: 2010 competitions: - event: Culture Mile Fusion Prize period: 2019 - 2020 result: Shortlisted - Team Knolo link: https://www.culturemile.london/fusion-prize-shortlist/knolo # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufmXwUdZJeY&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=CultureMile - event: RESI Hackathon period: 2018 result: Winners - Team FreeCycle link: https://medium.com/@bemyapp/resi-hackathon-2018-cbf185c29838 skills: - User Experience design (UX) - User Interface design (UI) - Graphic design - Cross platform design (Desktop, Native Mobile, responsive, smartwatch, kiosk etc.) - Design libraries and Styleguides - User journey mapping - User interviews and Usability testing - Information Architecture - Wireframing - Interactive prototypes - Contextual inquiry tools: - Sketch app, Figma - Flinto, Balsamiq, Invision, Zeplin, Marvel app - Adobe Creative Cloud Suite (Photoshop, XD, Illustrator, After Effects...) - HTML - CSS and SASS (SCSS) - jQuery (for prototyping only) - Jekyll - Frontend templating languages (ERB, Handlebars, Blade, Liquid) - Glyphs app, Fontlab, Fontographer about_site: | - Designed and built from scratch by me using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). - The typefaces used are [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) and [DM Serif Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Serif+Display), designed by [Colophon Foundry](https://www.colophon-foundry.org/). - Other tools and libraries used include, [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Headspace](https://github.com/gdub22/headspace) and [Normalize.css](http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css). - All the code for this site is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/mattgreydesign/mattgreydesign.github.io), deployed and hosted using [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). - Although the code is opensource under the GNU General Public License v3, all content is Copyrighted.
